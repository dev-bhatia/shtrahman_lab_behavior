# `./json`

This folder contains all the json files that store variables for the code to refer to.

**Note:** When running this program for the very first time on a new computer, you must rename the `./json/credentials_TEMPLATE.json` file to `credentials.json`, fill in the credentials in that `credentials.json` file, and then save your changes. This file allows the program to access the database and send automated emails.
